## Job Board API

This project is a job board API built using the FastAPI framework. It provides endpoints for users to create, read, update, and delete job postings and applicant information. The API also supports authentication using a username and password system.

**Features:**

* Create, read, update, and delete job postings
* Create, read, update, and delete applicant information
* Simple authentication using a username and password system
* Easy to deploy and scale

**Installation:**

To install the API, run the following command:

```
pip install job-board-api
```

**Usage:**

To start the API, run the following command:

```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The API will be running on http://localhost:8000.

**Endpoints:**

The following endpoints are available:

**Authentication:**

* `/login` (POST): Authenticate a user and return a JSON Web Token (JWT).
* `/logout` (POST): Invalidate a user's JWT.

**Job Postings:**

* `/job_postings` (GET): Get a list of all job postings.
* `/job_postings/{id}` (GET): Get a specific job posting by ID.
* `/job_postings` (POST): Create a new job posting.
* `/job_postings/{id}` (PUT): Update a job posting.
* `/job_postings/{id}` (DELETE): Delete a job posting.

**Applicants:**

* `/applicants` (GET): Get a list of all applicants.
* `/applicants/{id}` (GET): Get a specific applicant by ID.
* `/applicants` (POST): Create a new applicant.
* `/applicants/{id}` (PUT): Update an applicant.
* `/applicants/{id}` (DELETE): Delete an applicant.

**Example:**

To create a new job posting, send a POST request to the `/job_postings` endpoint with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "title": "Software Engineer",
  "description": "We are looking for a talented and experienced Software Engineer to join our team. The ideal candidate will have a strong understanding of Python, Django, and React.",
  "location": "San Francisco, CA"
}
```

If the request is successful, the API will return a JSON response with the following information:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Software Engineer",
  "description": "We are looking for a talented and experienced Software Engineer to join our team. The ideal candidate will have a strong understanding of Python, Django, and React.",
  "location": "San Francisco, CA",
  "created_at": "2023-10-08T20:40:32.000Z"
}
```

**Authentication:**

To authenticate with the API, send a POST request to the `/login` endpoint with your username and password in the JSON body. If the request is successful, the API will return a JSON response with a JWT.

You can then include the JWT in all subsequent requests to the API.

**Deployment:**

To deploy the API to a production environment, you can use a cloud hosting service such as Heroku or AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
